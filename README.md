# CS220 AU portfolio

## Portfolio items

1. **website** (40% of your overall mark) - https://1805864.github.io/CS220-AU-portfolio/#
2. **di reflection** (40% of your overall mark) - insert assessment URL
3. **self-and peer-assessment** (10% of your overall mark) - insert assessment URL
4. **portfolio overview** (10% of your overall mark) 

After you finish these items, add your student number and your portfolio's URL in the `final-check.md` file, complete a checklist in this file and along with the PDF version of your DI reflection, submit it on FASER. 

In essence, you need to submit two files on FASER:

1. di-reflection.pdf
2. final-check.md

But, before you submit, please rename both files to contain your student number e.g. like this:

1. 0610279-di-reflection.pdf
2. 0610279-final-check.md
