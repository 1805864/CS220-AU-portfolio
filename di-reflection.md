Digital Identity Reflection Essay

Introduction

Western society has acclimatised to using digital technology increasingly in different ways. Currently, people are using technology more for work as there has been more job opportunities created online, and children are made to use computers more frequently for online learning. Western society is now so integrated within technology that majority of us have created digital identities without us being aware. In this essay I will explain the concept of ‘digital identities’ and reflect on how they have shifted over time, including analysis of my own past, present and future digital identity.

What are digital identities?
Digital identities are the authentication of people’s identity in the digital world. In simpler terms, it is the identity that has been created digitally, by using technology in ways such as browsing the web or having social media accounts. Professor L. Jean Camp in her article ‘Digital Identity’ defines “identification in a digital networked world” as a “set of permanent or long-lived temporal attributes associated with an identity”1 It is essentially an online version of someone’s social identity.

Different types of digital identities

Majority of people use the internet to browse or stream media content, some may use it for work purposes, and many use it for both. When the COVID-19 pandemic began it meant that a lot of workplaces had shut down as government’s announced lockdowns for people around the world. This meant that a lot of people could not physically come into the workplace. So, to keep the economy going and to let people keep their jobs, the concept of ‘remote working’ or working from home was used more. This meant that there was a significant amount of people that were using their professional digital identities more than ever.

There can be different types of digital identities formed, such as personal which would be your personal presence on the internet, how you show yourself through social media such as Facebook or Instagram as you interact with personal connections and other personal digital identities such as family or friends.
Another type of identity is the professional identity, this is one that represents your more ‘professional’ life and can be attached to your work, and education etc. For example, this could be through being a part of sites such as LinkedIn, a place where you can network with other professionals and a place to manage your professional identity online.

Digital identities are fluid. They do not stay still, as time passes, we change and so does the way we use the internet. For example, as you get older you may need to use the internet for more professional purposes as you move into the workplace than just streaming or browsing. This can be separated into three categories, past, present, and future digital identities. Your past digital identity is one that you started with, when you first started to have a presence on the web. Your present identity is what your digital identity is currently, and your future digital identity is the one that you aim to become in the future.

Furthermore, our identities can be categorised into two types of people, ‘Digital Natives’ and ‘Digital Immigrants’. These terms were coined by Marc Prensky who describes Digital Natives as the new generation who were born into the digital age as they would be “native speakers”2, and “Digital Immigrants” who are the older generation that had to learn and make a shift from analogue to digital.

What is a digital visitor and resident map?

According to David S. White, a digital visitor and resident map is the “ways in which people’s online engagement might be conceptualised… and is also a way of describing the range of ways individuals can engage with the web” 3You can place yourself on the map as either a ‘visitor’ or a ‘resident’ of the web. Being a visitor refers to having a specific task or goal when going onto the web for that only reason once it has been completed. Resident mode refers to being online for the purpose of being connected or socialising with people. It also shows that people’s engagement on the app is either in on a ‘personal’ platform for example websites that are attached their personal identity or ‘institutional’ platform, which are established websites that people can go to for more professional purposes.

Analysis of my personal present visitor and resident map:

Here I have placed my own web activity on the visitor and resident map, as you can see most of my activity reside in both visitor and resident, showing that I perform tasks and like to be online and socialise. This is because most of my activities are consuming media content and using social media to connect with people. I currently have some activity in the institution section, this is because in this point of my life I am currently attending university and networking is important for future connections and career. 2 Prensky, Marc.

My future visitor and resident map:

Analysis of future visitor and resident map:

The only thing that I have changed is the institutional and professional mode. This is because in the future, I would have graduated university, and therefore would not need to use the university online services as I am not a student. I then replaced that with workplace tasks, this is because I assume that I would have started a career and would have to do online tasks referring to my future work. I also added other sites to connect with professionals, this could be for future job opportunities and just general networking as this might be something I would do in the future, this is also because the future jobs will become more of a concern to me.
In conclusion, being aware of your digital identity is imperative as we live in a constantly changing digital world. It was interesting for me to reflect on my own identities as it makes you think about how you present yourself for the future. Using GitHub pages to create a portfolio website was exciting for me as was able to present myself professionally which is something, I had not had a chance to do yet.
