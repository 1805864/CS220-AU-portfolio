Graphic Design : I am a self taught designer which means that i use resources such as youtube, and free courses online to practice and teach myself how to use design programmes. As a freelance graphics designer, i use programmes such as adobe illustrator and photoshop to create many designs. In my experience i have made logos, posters, and music cover art. My interest in design started around 2019 when one of my friends who was releasing a song and needed someone to make cover art for it. At the time i had never made anything but i figured it out and enjoyed the process and from then i advertised to peers and other students my services and over time started making cover art for them. To practice i also designed posters for fun, and uploaded them to instagram. This is when i began my brand identity. 'Allisha's Art' is a business account that was made to post my designs, both professional and conceptual. This was also a good way for me to find clients etc.
