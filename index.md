My name is Nadia Georgiou. I am a qualified counsellor offering a Person-Centred approach. I am a registered member of the BACP (British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy), currently studying at the University of Essex Colchester, where I engage in Psychosocial and Psychoanalytic studies. 
What I was able to gain from my studies so far is a different range of perspectives, in-depth psychoanalytic and psychosocial studies, This, I was able to acquire various theoretical, methodological and critical applications on concepts relating to the studies. I have participed in and developed critical thinking concerning the human mind,behaviour and view oon our society as a student.  

I have been counselling since 2016 and obtained my full counselling qualification in 2018. Due to my client work cases, which mainly includes clients dealing with sexual assults, violent domestic relationships, other traumatic events, bereavenmt and depression. In 2020 I decided to enrol on undergraduate studies in order to gain a greater understanding of the theory rather than a skills, which will provide me with some inside into human behaviour. It will offer an answer of internal world of individual. Therefore, allowing me to be better eguipped to provide greater understanding to my clients, including the ability of considerate empathy, comprehension and safer conditions. 

Currently I am volunteering with the Open Road organisation as an Appropriate adult. Open Road organisation provides Criminal Justice Srvices which are aimed at safeguarging communities and reducing offending within the community. The role of an Appropriate Adult the role is to look after the detained persons welfare, provide information about the detained persons rights and ensure that these are protected and advise the detained person. The role of the Appropriate Adult was first introduced under the Police and Criminal Act 1984 (PACE).

As a counsellor, it comes as my second nature not to make a pre-judgement of people. Therefore, volunteering for such an organisation and in an environment of such nature was a good opportunity of observing and realising human behaviour.

Thank you so much for the help and support you have given me these past few months. You have helped me in ways I could never have imagined and I am so grateful for your time, kind words and encouragement. You are so easy to talk to and our positive relationship made me feel comfortable enough to talk. I am quite sad to know I won't see you again, but I am thankful that I am ready to move forward.
